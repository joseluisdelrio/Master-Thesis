A Pectin-Based Prebiotic Fiber Modulates Liver Transcriptome Dysregulation in Diet-Induced Obese Mice. Transcriptomic analysis in R.

This repository contains the Bash and R scripts used for transcriptomic analysis to investigate the effects of olive pomaceâ€“derived pectin 
on obesity-induced hepatic dysregulation in mice. The analysis include data preprocessing, normalization, differential gene expression analysis, 
enrichment anaylsis (GO and KEGG) and sPLS-DA modelling to explore how gene expression is altered by a high fat diet and the supplementation
of pectin.
